ODP-CMMS is an Oracle DB integrated with winform C# Windows Application (Uppon ODP Request and can be done with a Cloud Based/ Web Application with any selected Language)
The created CMMS integrates the three main Departments (Maintenace and Repair/ Finance/ Stores Management) and can be interpretted as an ERP system.
The reason why I advised you to have at leat a team member related to Maintenance Activities is that he can emphasize the whole core Moduels to his team and the coordination between them.
